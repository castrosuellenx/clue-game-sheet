# 🕵️‍♂️ Clue Notes Sheet (WIP)
A modern **Next.js** application that works as a notes sheet for the board game **Clue**, inspired by the digital version available on Steam.

This project is part of my portfolio and focuses on **clean UI, good UX, and solid frontend best practices**.

## 🤔 Why This Project?
This app is not just a technical demo — it’s personal.

- **Clue is one of my favorite games.** I love to play it, especially with my friends.
- **I dislike the traditional paper sheet.** The online version's sheet is much cleaner, faster to use, and easier to track during the game — and I wanted something like that for the physical version.
- **My friends struggle with the paper sheet too.** It often makes the game messy or slows things down, so it’s hard to convince them to play.  
  Building a digital sheet is my way to fix that and make the game more accessible for everyone at the table.

It’s a perfect project to showcase my frontend strengths while solving a real problem I actually care about.
